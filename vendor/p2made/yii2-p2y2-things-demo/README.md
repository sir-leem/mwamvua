---

A set of pages to demonstrate [`p2made/yii2-p2y2-things`](https://github.com/p2made/yii2-p2y2-things), bundled as a theme.

It declares p2made/yii2-p2y2-things as a dependancy.

¡¡ IMPORTANT !!
===============

Version 2.0.0 of all my Yii2 add-ons marks a breaking change where I've shortened my namespaces.
`p2made\rest\of\namespace` is now `p2m\rest\of\namespace`.

Installation
------------

The preferred way to install P2Y2Things Demo is through [composer](http://getcomposer.org/download/).
Depending on your composer installation, run *one* of the following commands:

```
composer require --prefer-dist p2made/yii2-p2y2-things-demo "^2.8"
```

or

```
php composer.phar require --prefer-dist p2made/yii2-p2y2-things-demo "^2.8"
```

Alternatively add:

```
"p2made/yii2-p2y2-things-demo": "^2.8"
```

to the requires section of your `composer.json` file & P2Y2Things Demo will be installed next time you run `composer update`.

The files are installed via Yii's recommended usage of the `fxp/composer-asset-plugin`.

Quick Start
-----------

Once the extension is installed, you can have a *preview* by reconfiguring the path mappings of the view component:

```
	'components' => [
		'view' => [
			'theme' => [
				'pathMap' => [
					'@app/views' => '@vendor/p2m/yii2-p2y2-things-demo/views',
				],
			],
		],
	],
```

To view pages in `site/pages/` you need to modify `actions()` in the `SiteController`:

```
	public function actions()
	{
		return [
			...
			'page' => [
				'class' => 'yii\web\ViewAction',
			],
		];
	}
```

And then...
-----------

P2Y2Things Demo uses [P2Y2Things](https://github.com/p2made/yii2-p2y2-things) which requires some Yii 2 assets to be nullified to avoid conflicts through double loading. Modify `common/config/main.php` with...

```
	'components' => [
		'assetManager' => [
			'bundles' => [
				'yii\web\JqueryAsset' => [
					'sourcePath' => null, 'js' => [],
				],
				'yii\bootstrap\BootstrapAsset' => [
					'sourcePath' => null, 'css' => [],
				],
				'yii\bootstrap\BootstrapPluginAsset' => [
					'sourcePath' => null, 'js' => [],
				],
				'yii\jui\JuiAsset' => [
					'sourcePath' => null, 'css' => [], 'js' => [],
				],
				'\rmrevin\yii\fontawesome\AssetBundle' => [
					'sourcePath' => null, 'css' => [],
				],
			],
		],
		...
	],
```

**DO NOT** modify the views in the  `views/` folder. Your changes will be lost next time you run `composer update`.

You can copy elements from these examples into your own views.
