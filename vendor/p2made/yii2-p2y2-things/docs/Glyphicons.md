Glyphicons Asset Bundle & Helpers
==================================

This extension wraps Bootstrap Glyphicons in a manner similar to [rmrevin/yii2-fontawesome](https://github.com/rmrevin/yii2-fontawesome).

Usage
-----

Once P2Y2Things is installed, here's how you use Glyphicons in your code.

There's no need to register any assets, because Bootstrap, which Glyphicons is part of, is already loaded.

Include `use p2m\helpers\GI;` at the top of the page.

Now your page is ready for Glyphicons!
